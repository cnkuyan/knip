	<shortDescription>
		Compares two tables of segments (binary image masks)
		according to how many relativ pixels they have in common. Hence the
		actual segment shape AND the offset (minimum) of the bitmasks are
		considered. NOTE that the sources of the bitmasks have to be the same!
		A column with the maximum relative pixel aggreement with
		respect
		to the
		reference segments is appended to the target column.

		<intro>
			Compares two tables of segments (binary images) according to
			how many relativ pixels they have in common (Number of the pixels of
			the intersection divided by the number of pixels of the union (IoU)).
			Hence the actual segment shape AND the offset (minimum) of the
			bitmasks are considered. NOTE that the sources of the bitmasks have
			to be the same! A column with the relative pixel aggreement with
			respect to the reference segments is appended to the target column.
			Also, optionally, the number of overlaps and a collection of all
			overlapping row keys of the overlapping segments are appended.
		</intro>
		<option name="Append number of overlaps">
			Appends the number of overlapping segments of the
			reference table.
		</option>
		<option name="Append row keys of overlapping segments">
			Appends the row keys of the overlapping segments
			of the reference table.
		</option>
