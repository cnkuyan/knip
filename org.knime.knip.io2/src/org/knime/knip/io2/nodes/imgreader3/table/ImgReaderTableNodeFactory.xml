	<name>Image Reader (Table) Remote</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Reads images from possibly different remote locations
		into a
		KNIME-internal image format.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Reads images from various file formats supported by the Bio-Formats
			library and imports them to the KNIME-internal image format.
			A list of the supported formats can be found here:
			<a href="http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/formats">http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/formats</a>
			.

			The image locations have to be provided as URI's as well as a
			fitting connection information needs to be present. 
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Image Factory">Defines the way how the images are created and
				therewith kept in memory: Array Image Factory (stored as ONE array;
				pros: fast pixel access; cons: limited number of pixels per image),
				Planar Image Factory (each plane is stored in an array; pros: images
				are read faster; cons: limited number of pixels in an XY-plane,
				slower pixel access), and Cell Image Factory (multiple arrays of
				fixed sizes are used, pros: unlimited number of pixels per images;
				cons: slower pixel reading and pixel access))
